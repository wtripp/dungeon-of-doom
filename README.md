# dungeon-of-doom
A simple text-based adventure game created in Python.

I created this game as part of the homework for Learn Python the Hard Way: Lesson 45, "You Make a Game." Putting this game together helped me solidify my understanding of object-oriented programming.

In the game, you travel from room to room, fighting monsters and picking up items. The descriptions are extremely basic right now. I used up all of my creativity just to get this game to work. The game contains only six rooms for now, but if I implemented OOP correctly, I should be able to add new rooms, enemies, and items without TOO much trouble (famous last words).

To play the game, at the command line, navigate to the directory containing these files and enter:
```
python game.py
```
Then, have fun!
